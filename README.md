# SNHU_SprintReview_Retrospective
This is a sprint review I did in week 7 at SNHU


1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Making sure that the user needs are met is a big thing in software design. Asking the user what they want or expect 
from the program will maker the process way easier in the long run. 
User stories help with thids because we pretty mcuh know what the user is looking for or wanting from the program.



2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   I hope to use any of the agile processes that I have learned the last 8 weeks. Scrum is a big part of development I would take advantage of.
   I would also say that, any of the scaling practices would be great to use, but would definatly usse the Scrum process going into development.  



3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   Being a good team meamber is the first word. "TEAMwork" without that I really don't see a future in software development.
   This is a big part in this industry because no matter what I see you mostly working in teams.
   Being a good team member is listening, showing up and putting in work.
